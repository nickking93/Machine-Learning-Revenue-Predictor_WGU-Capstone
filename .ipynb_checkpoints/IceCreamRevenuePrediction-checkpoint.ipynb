    "This project aims to develop a machine learning tool for Frosty Forecasts Ice Cream Co. to predict daily revenue based on outside temperature. By leveraging historical data on temperature and associated revenues, the project will utilize linear regression and gradient descent to model the relationship between them. The primary goal is to enable Frosty Forecasts Ice Cream Co. to make informed decisions about deploying ice cream trucks, ensuring operations are profitable by identifying optimal days for sales. This predictive capability will enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and maximize revenue, ultimately contributing to the companyâ€™s success."

    "The dataset being used for this project is a fictional sample created for educational purposes and obtained from kaggle.com. It represents historical data for the fictional company Frosty Forecasts Ice Cream Co. and focuses on the relationship between temperature and revenue. It includes data points that illustrate how the company's daily revenue varies with changes in temperature. Each entry in the dataset records the daily temperature and the corresponding revenue generated by Frosty Forecasts, providing a simplified yet practical scenario for analyzing and understanding basic machine learning concepts. This synthetic dataset is chosen to facilitate learning by offering a clear, easy-to-follow example of how external factors, like outside temperature, can influence business performance."
