# INTRODUCTION
Before starting this task, ensure that your capstone project has been approved by your instructor.

In this task, you will design, develop, and implement the capstone project approved by your instructor in Task 1.

Note: Your work for this task will not be evaluated until you have successfully passed Task 1.

# REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. The similarity report that is provided when you submit your task can be used as a guide.

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).

•   an outline of the data product

•   a description of the data that will be used to construct the data product

•   the objectives and hypotheses of the project

•   an outline of the project methodology

•   funding requirements

•   the impact of the solution on stakeholders

•   ethical and legal considerations and precautions that will be used when working with and communicating about sensitive data

•   your expertise relevant to the solution you propose
 
    Note: Expertise described here could be real or hypothetical to fit the project topic you have created.

B.  Write an executive summary directed to IT professionals that addresses each of the following requirements:

•   code used to perform the analysis of the data and construct a descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive data product

•   assessment of the hypotheses for acceptance or rejection

•   visualizations and elements of effective storytelling supporting the data exploration and preparation, data analysis, and data summary, including the phenomenon and its detection

•   assessment of the product’s accuracy 

•   the results from the data product testing, revisions, and optimization based on the provided plans, including screenshots

•   source code and executable file(s)

•   a quick-start guide summarizing the steps necessary to install and use the product
