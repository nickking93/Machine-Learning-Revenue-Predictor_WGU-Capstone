# Ice Cream Truck Revenue Prediction

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the daily revenue of an ice cream truck business based solely on outside temperature. The model employs linear regression to establish a relationship between temperature and sales, enabling the business to forecast revenue and optimize operations.

## Overview

Ice cream sales are strongly influenced by weather conditions, particularly temperature. This project focuses on using historical temperature and revenue data to build a predictive model. By utilizing Python and its data science libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, the project demonstrates the power of linear regression in forecasting daily revenue based on temperature.

## Features

- **Temperature-Based Prediction:** The model uses historical temperature data to predict daily ice cream sales, allowing for simple yet effective revenue forecasting.
- **Linear Regression Model:** A straightforward linear regression approach is applied to model the relationship between temperature and revenue.
- **Basic Data Visualization:** The project includes visualizations to explore the relationship between temperature and revenue, as well as to present the model's predictions.
